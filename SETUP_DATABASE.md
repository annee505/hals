# Quick Start: Running Database Schema

## Step 1: Run SQL in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mvhqltaocpctmgbwkxdq
2. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New query"
4. Open the file `supabase-schema.sql` (in your project root)
5. Copy ALL the SQL code
6. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
7. Click "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
8. Wait for it to complete - you should see "Success. No rows returned"

That's it! Your database is now set up with all the tables.

## Step 2: Verify Tables Created

1. Click "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
2. You should see all these tables:
   - users
   - courses
   - modules
   - lessons
   - enrollments
   - lesson_progress
   - quizzes
   - quiz_questions
   - quiz_attempts

If you see all these tables, you're done! The implementation will continue automatically.
